Changelog for Beam-Minion

{{ $NEXT }}

    [Changed]

    - The worker is now able to run tasks from all containers by
      default. This opens up Minion queues to be used for other
      purposes, such as prioritization and partitioning jobs.

0.006     2017-08-22 18:48:33-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed issue with passing plain DBI DSNs: The backend expects
      a list of arguments, not an arrayref of arguments.

    - Moved log to STDERR. This is temporary until we can come up with
      some more robust logging configuration (probably Log::Any)

0.005     2017-08-19 21:42:31-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed raw Minion args to allow passing plain DBI DSNs. This allows
      me to use the `mysql_read_defaults_file` DBD::mysql configuration.

0.004     2017-08-14 13:01:07-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added `enqueue` Perl API to the Beam::Minion module. This makes it
      easier to add jobs via Perl instead of using the command-line (or
      the command class)

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed deprecated use of `slurp` from Mojolicious
    - Fixed some error messages to be easier to understand for the user

0.003     2017-04-28 01:26:54-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Missing BEAM_MINION environment variable now shows a more friendly
      error message

    [Added]

    - Added some basic getting started documentation in preparation for
      writing some tutorials

0.002     2017-01-15 14:15:44-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Updated prereq versions to have all the features we need

0.001     2017-01-13 20:01:57-06:00 America/Chicago

    - Initial release
